# Teams Mouse Jiggler 🖱️

A free and open-source tool that prevents your computer from going idle by simulating mouse activity.  
This version is packaged as a standalone `.exe` with its required runtime files.

## 📦 Download
➡️ Get the latest version from the [Releases page](../../releases).

The ZIP contains:
- `Teams.exe` → the main program
- `_internal/` → required runtime files (do not delete or move)

⚠️ **Important**: `Teams.exe` must stay in the same folder as `_internal/`.  
If you move the `.exe` without `_internal/`, the app won’t work.

## 🔧 How to Use
1. Download `Teams-vX.Y.Z.zip` from [Releases](../../releases).
2. Extract the ZIP to a folder of your choice.
3. Run `Teams.exe`.

No installation required ✅
